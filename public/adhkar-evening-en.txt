        MORNING REMEMBRANCES
═══════════════════════════════════════════

1. Ayat Al-Kursi (The Throne Verse)
Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.
[Once]

2. The Last Two Verses of Surah Al-Baqarah
The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so have the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, saying, "We make no distinction between any of His messengers." And they say, "We hear and we obey. We seek Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the final destination." Allah does not charge a soul except with that within its capacity. It will have the consequence of what it has gained, and it will bear the consequence of what it has earned. "Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people."
[Once]

3. Surah Al-Ikhlas and the Two Protective Surahs
Say, "He is Allah, the One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent."

Say, "I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak from the evil of that which He created and from the evil of darkness when it settles and from the evil of the blowers in knots and from the evil of an envier when he envies."

Say, "I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, the Sovereign of mankind, the God of mankind, from the evil of the retreating whisperer - who whispers evil into the breasts of mankind - from among the jinn and mankind."
[Three times]

4. We Have Reached the Morning
We have reached the morning and at this very time all sovereignty belongs to Allah. Praise is to Allah. None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, alone, without partner. To Him belongs all sovereignty and praise, and He is over all things competent. My Lord, I ask You for the good of this day and the good of what follows it, and I take refuge in You from the evil of this day and the evil of what follows it. My Lord, I take refuge in You from laziness and senility. My Lord, I take refuge in You from torment in the Fire and punishment in the grave.
